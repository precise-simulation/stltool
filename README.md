About
-----

**STLTool** is a MATLAB® toolbox for pre-processing STL CAD geometries
  for use with the [FEATool Multiphysics](https://www.featool.com)
  PDE simulation toolbox.


Features
--------

- Supports binary and ascii STL and OBJ CAD geometry formats
- Polygon reduction using
  [fast quadratic mesh simplification](https://github.com/sp4cerat/Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification)
  by Sven Forstmann or alternatively the built-in reducepatch function
- Boundary and feature identification (saved as different ascii STL
  solid segments)
